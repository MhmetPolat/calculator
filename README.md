# Features
-Addition: Adds two numbers.
-Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
-Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
-Division: Divides the first number by the second. Note: The program handles division by zero with an error message.

# How It Works
When you run the program, it prompts the user to:
1. Select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
2. Enter two numbers for the calculation.
3. The program then performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
4. If the user selects an invalid option, the program will notify them of the error.
